The terminology of the mouse settings in Linux (Xorg) are slightly different from the windows world.

There are three important settings:

threshold - The trigger for acceleration
acceleration - The speed after the threshold has been reached
resolution - The "speed"
These settings are independent of the Desktop Environment. They are pure X settings. So this always works. See also the mouse section of xset for a truly independent way to change these settings.

The Unity settings manager seems to rename the threshold to sensitivity. But as you are talking about KDE, that should not matter.

Only threshold and acceleration can be changed by the user. The resolution is a setting to be made in xorg.conf. But usually, the first two settings are enough for most users.

Linuxreviews has an explanation of these values.

Basically: The mouse moves at a base speed (modifiable using resolution). If the mouse moves n pixels (n = threshold) in a short time, then the base speed is multiplied with acceleration. As an example, if you want to disable acceleration completely, you can set the threshold to 0. In words: If the mouse moves 0 pixels in a short time, I'll use base-speed * acceleration. So a threshold of 0 gives you constant mouse-speed.

The solution is:

Set "Pointer threshold" to 0. As a result, the second speed will be applied at all times.
Adjust "Pointer acceleration" to make that speed higher or lower.
You will end up with a constant, non-dynamic cursor speed adjusted to your liking.

So, these two values give you a very fine grained control over the speed.
