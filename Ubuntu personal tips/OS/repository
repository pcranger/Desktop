With a windows machine, you have to troll around the internet to find a program that you want to install. With linux machines, since all of the programs are free and open source, the compiled programs and the source code are hosted on big servers that are maintained by a team of volunteers.

The list of available packages (programs) available on a given server is a repository. The advantage of this is that it makes installation and updates super easy. All of the programs are installed from the same interface ( in the case of Ubuntu, the Add Remove program ) and are updated automatically when any bugs are patched. There are lots of ways of installing new packages and adding new repositories - but for now you probably want to work in a GUI rather than a terminal. If you want to see some of the more technical bits of your system you can try the synaptic package manager until you feel comfortable going into a terminal and editing the configurations manually (this is how I prefer to do it).
