To open nautilus from terminal.

nautilus .

To open nautilus in the background and still use the terminal.

nohup nautilus . > /dev/null 2>&1 &

You can also make that an alias.

alias open='nohup nautilus . > /dev/null 2>&1 &'

You can also add that alias to .bash_aliases, to have it persistent.

echo "alias open='nohup nautilus . > /dev/null 2>&1 &'" >> .bash_aliases

So now, after restarting the terminal, you can just type open.
