PPA stands for Personal Package Archives.

Usually we use PPA when a particular is not available in Official Software repo.

From a developer point of view, say you developed a program X. If X is hugely popular then it might make its way in to official Repo.

If not, you can create your own software repo in LaunchPad website( thats where you can get the ppa's mostly). And then upload your program , and viola you have your own ppa. Users then can install from this ppa.

Arch linux has somewhat a variation of this called Aur (Arch User Repo), but aur is much easier to use, i guess.

Hope this helps :)
